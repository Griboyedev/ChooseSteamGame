This is a very basic program that goes to the steam file path, makes a list of what is in the game folder, and chooses one at random from there. 
Just a useful tool if you look at your desktop a cant choose from your games
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang I could have just used the desktop filepath and tries to exclude the recycling bin instead of steam and it's files. I'll look into this.
Oh by the way I think windows probably hates this file when I tried to run it it blocked it. 
I'll upload the source file when I figure out how but theres nothing spooky here.
